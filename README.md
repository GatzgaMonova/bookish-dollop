Hello! This repository is my little project area. It'll likely be JavaScript, Python, C, and C++. Programming is not a new concept to me, but I would enjoy learning it.
This is a practice area. You can fork my code, and mock it. I'll try to make some interesting projects here. Inthemeanwhile, have a good day.
